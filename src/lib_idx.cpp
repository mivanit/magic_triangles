// currently two different index formats are used,
// along with one coordinate system
// no good names for them yet, but
// the code gathered in src/calc.cpp uses a system optimized for calculation by placement of card
// the invertible matricies code uses a system optimized for modular arithmetic

// there is also a coordinate system that uses two values (row, place) to determine a card
